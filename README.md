## Description

`Discord-bot-inventory-wtn` is a Discord bot that helps manage an inventory of sneakers. The bot allows users to add and remove sneakers, search for models by name or SKU, and get notified when specific sizes or models become available. This bot is specifically designed for sneaker enthusiasts who want to keep track of their collections and be notified of updates.

The bot was integrated with a monitor for WTN (WeTheNew), a popular sneaker marketplace. WTN frequently posted buy requests for specific sneakers that they wanted to purchase. Users could list their sneakers in the botâ€™s inventory, including the sizes they had for sale. Whenever WTN posted a buy request that matched a sneaker and size from a user's inventory, the bot would instantly notify the user, allowing them to quickly respond to the opportunity and sell their sneakers to WTN. This functionality helped users capitalize on potential sales and react swiftly to buy requests, ensuring they didn't miss any selling opportunities.
